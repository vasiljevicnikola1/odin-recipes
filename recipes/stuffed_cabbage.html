    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This cabbage rolls recipe is super easy to prep with cabbage leaves, ground beef, rice, and condensed tomato soup. I have been using this recipe for well over 20 years and still love it! 
       To speed things up the rolls are cooked in a skillet on the stovetop but this recipe also works well in a slow cooker.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅔ cup water</li>
        <li>⅓ cup uncooked white rice</li>
        <li>8 cabbage leaves</li>
        <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 large egg, slightly beaten</li>
        <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed tomato soup, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>    
        <li>Bring water and rice to a boil in a saucepan.</li> 
        <li>Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and liquid has been absorbed, about 20 minutes.</li> 
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large, wide saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Add cabbage leaves and cook for 2 to 4 minutes or until softened; drain.</li> 
        <li>Combine ground beef, 1 cup of cooked rice, onion, beaten egg, 2 tablespoons of tomato soup, salt, and pepper in a large bowl; mix thoroughly.</li> 
        <li>Spoon about 2 tablespoons of beef mixture onto each cabbage leaf.</li> 
        <li>Bring one end of the cabbage leaf over the mixture.</li> 
        <li>Roll and tuck in the ends to prevent the filling from falling out.</li> 
        <li>Place cabbage rolls in a large skillet over medium heat.</li> 
        <li>Pour remaining tomato soup on top</li> 
        <li>Cover and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low and simmer for about 40 minutes, stirring and basting with the liquid often.</li> 
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>
